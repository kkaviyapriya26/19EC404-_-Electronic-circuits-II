### **Result**

Thus the current shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | =25 Hz | =250Hz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | = 170 Hz | = 450 Hz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 169.9KHz\) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 449 KHz\) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 26.5 dB \) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 25.2 dB \) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | 23.5 dB | 22.54 dB |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
